**MultipleWorkoutExercises.py**: all of them from the book `Python Workout: 50 Ten-minute Exercises`. Perfect if want to practice Python.

**TicTacToe.py**: The classic program you do because every single Youtube video says so.

**host_monitor**: A project were you had to "ping" a host and depending on the data recieved you could mail or not the owner or person in charge of it.

**Sudoku_resolver**: Only for 9x9, includes a simple interface made with Pygame. It will throw an error if it can't a solution and in other cases if you did something specific. The idea is to not mess around too much and put the sudoku from the newspaper.
