# My old Python Projects

This repository is used to store some of the Python projects I did in the past.

They are really simple and I have no plans to continue them, they were made to learns specific topics and nothing else.

## Flask Application

Used to learn the basics of Flask. 

It is a ticket purchase page. Includes a route to:
- Log in
- Buy tickets from one city to another.
- Visualize the tickets, with the option to delete them.

  It was a fine mini-project to explore the backend and suffer while bit using HTML and CSS.

  ## Old-College-Exercises

  Training exercises I did back then when I was learning the basics of Python.

  ## Portswigger_Labs.

  A back-up for the SQLI labs I did
